#Disease Resistance Genes

##(NLRs)

The Hidden Markov Model for the NB-ARC domain (PF00931) was used to search the proteomes specified in Table 1 using the gathering bit score threshold.


##(AMPs)

working directory: ./dk_resistance genes/duckweed_amp/

A total of 268 antimicrobial peptide sequences were analyzed from the PhytAMP database (Hammammi et al., 2009). These peptide sequences were comprised of cyclotides, defensins, heveins, impatiens, knottins, lipid transfer proteins, sheperins, thionins, and vicilins. HMMR versions 3.1b2 was used to build Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) for each peptide family. These HMMs were used to search the proteomes specified in Table 1 using the gathering bit score threshold.
