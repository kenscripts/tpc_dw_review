# Disease Resistance Genes

## (NLRs)

`working directory: ./dk_disease_resistance genes/duckweed_nbarc/`

The HMM model for the NB-ARC domain (PF00931) was used to search the proteomes specified in Table 1 with HMMR version 3.1b2 using the gathering bit score threshold.


## (AMPs)

`working directory: ./dk_disease_resistance genes/duckweed_amp/`

A total of 268 antimicrobial peptide sequences were analyzed from the PhytAMP database (Hammammi et al., 2009). These peptide sequences were comprised of cyclotides, defensins, heveins, impatiens, knottins, lipid transfer proteins, sheperins, thionins, and vicilins. HMMR version 3.1b2 was used to build HMMs for each peptide family. These HMMs were then used to search the proteomes specified in Table 1 using the gathering bit score threshold.
